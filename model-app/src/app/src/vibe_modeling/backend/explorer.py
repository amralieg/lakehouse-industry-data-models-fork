       ``v{N}/{scope}/model.json`` then the legacy flat
       ``{scope}_v{N}/model.json`` and probes each via
       ``ws.files.get_metadata`` (raises ``NotFound`` when the file is
       absent). Catches the case where the agent wrote the artifact but
       ``sync_model`` failed before a ``RunArtifact`` row was inserted, and
       the case where ``vibe_iterate`` produced a version without indexing
       artifacts at all.
    1. **RunArtifact lookup** by ``(business, version, scope)``. The
       ``artifact_type`` value MUST match what the writers emit - the
       canonical value is ``"model_json"`` (see vibe_iterate's
       ``_finalize_success`` and the post-success indexing in
       ``progress_tracker.index_artifacts_for_version``).
    2. **Convention docs path** where the agent wrote

       legacy flat ``{scope}_v{N}/docs/...`` variant.
