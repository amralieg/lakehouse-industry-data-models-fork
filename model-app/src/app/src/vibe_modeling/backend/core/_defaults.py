SUPPORTED_AGENT_VERSION = "v0.8.0"
"""Git **release** tag of the vibe-modelling-agent this app targets.

From v0.8.0 the agent carries two independent identities:

  * the **release** identity — the git tag (`v0.8.0`), stamped into the
    notebook's top-cell ``__RELEASE_VERSION__`` constant and into every
    model.json as ``release_version`` ("0.8.0"). This is what the app
    displays, records against imported versions, looks up in the
    compatibility matrix, AND gates on: the notebook-version preflight
    compares the notebook's release against `SUPPORTED_AGENT_VERSION`,
    because the release version tracks the app-agent interface.
  * the **agent-logic marker** — an independent counter (`4.x.y`) stamped
    in the notebook's top-cell ``__AGENT_VERSION__`` constant and in the
    model.json ``agent_version`` field. `SUPPORTED_AGENT_MARKER` is that
    value. It is a per-fix build counter used for traceability/display
    only; it does NOT gate compatibility, so it can move within a release
    (e.g. 4.9.9 → 4.9.10 under release 0.8.0) without a re-pin.

Before v0.8.0 the two were the same string (the agent stamped its release
semver as ``agent_version``); the split means the notebook marker (`4.9.9`)
no longer matches the release tag (`v0.8.0`). Pre-v0.8.0 notebooks that carry
no ``__RELEASE_VERSION__`` fall back to the marker as their release identity.
Shipped as the bundled default via
`src/app/vendored/agent/vibe_modelling_agent_v4.9.9.ipynb`.
"""

SUPPORTED_AGENT_MARKER = "4.9.9"
"""Agent-logic marker for the pinned release (notebook ``__AGENT_VERSION__``).

Decoupled from `SUPPORTED_AGENT_VERSION` (the release tag) at v0.8.0. This is a
per-fix build counter for traceability only: it is stamped into model.json as
``agent_version`` and logged at startup, but it does NOT gate compatibility.
The notebook-version preflight (`routes/_helpers._preflight_notebook_version`,
`routes/config.check_agent_notebook`) gates on the release version, not this
marker, so a patch bump here on the same release does not require a re-pin.
