"""Atomic run-state transition helper.

ALL terminal state changes for a Run — cancel, fail, succeed, rolled_back —
MUST go through :func:`transition_run`.  No other code is allowed to write
to ``Run.status``, ``Run.completed_at``, ``Run.progress_message``, or
``RunOperation.status`` for terminal statuses directly.

Intent
------
The cancel endpoint historically flipped ``Run.status`` to ``"cancelled"``
but left every other layer untouched:

* ``RunOperation`` rows stayed ``"running"`` / ``"pending"``
* ``Run.progress_message`` kept the stale ``"[generate_ecm] …RUNNING…"`` text
* ``Run.completed_at`` was not set  →  elapsed timer kept ticking
* The Databricks job kept running (no cancel API call)

This helper closes all five gaps in a single call that the caller commits.

All terminal writes route through ``transition_run``.  The
``"running"`` / ``"stale"`` non-terminal writes stay in-place (they are
progress updates, not terminal transitions).

    Layers updated (in order):
    1. ``Run.status`` → ``target_status``
    2. ``Run.completed_at`` → now (always; these are all terminal)
    3. Every ``RunOperation`` with status in {pending, running} →
       target-aware terminal:
       - ``cancelled``          → running ops cancelled, pending ops cancelled
       - ``failed``             → running op failed, pending ops skipped
       - ``succeeded``          → assert no in-flight ops (caller bug if any)

       NEVER leaves a stale "RUNNING …" message.
    5. Best-effort Databricks job cancel (only when ``target_status`` is
       ``"cancelled"`` or ``"rolled_back_failed"``).

    Parameters
    ----------
    session:
        Open SQLModel session. Caller is responsible for ``session.commit()``
        after this call returns.
    run:
        The ``Run`` instance to transition (mutated in place).
    target_status:
        One of the terminal values above.
    reason:
        Optional human-readable cause (surfaces in the progress message for
        ``failed`` / ``rolled_back_failed``).
    ws:
        Databricks ``WorkspaceClient`` (or ``None``).  When provided and the
        run has a ``databricks_run_id``, a best-effort ``jobs.cancel_run``
        is issued for cancellation targets.

    Returns
    -------
    The same ``Run`` instance, mutated.  Caller commits.

    Wiring audit
    ------------
    **Intent**: single authoritative place for all terminal Run transitions.

    **Previous wiring**: each caller (router cancel handler, orchestrator
    rollback path, tracker watchdog) wrote ``run.status`` / ``run.completed_at``
    directly and left RunOperation rows and ``progress_message`` untouched.

    **New wiring**: callers call ``transition_run``; no direct ``run.status =``
    assignment for terminal statuses anywhere except this function.

    **Info-flow delta**:
    + RunOperation rows now always reach a terminal status when the Run does.
    + ``run.progress_message`` is always overwritten with a non-RUNNING string.
    + ``run.completed_at`` is always stamped on terminal (was sometimes missing).
    + Best-effort Databricks cancel is attempted for cancel targets.
    - No new callers introduced; all existing callers rerouted here.

    **Dead-end check**: ``run.progress_message`` was the only field that could
    become stale (RUNNING after cancel). This is now closed. No columns are
    left unused; no new columns are introduced.
