"""Tests for the Industry catalog endpoints — focused on DELETE.

The existing list / create / update paths are covered indirectly by the
contracts + RBAC test suites; this file exists to gate the
``deleteIndustry`` endpoint so a refactor can't silently turn it back
into a 200 on the in-use case (which would let the user nuke an
industry that businesses still reference and leave FKs dangling).
