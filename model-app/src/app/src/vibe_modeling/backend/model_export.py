"""Model export — reconstruct a ``model.json`` bundle from the Lakebase
version rows. The inverse of :meth:`ModelSyncService.sync_from_model_json`.

``sync_from_model_json`` reads a ``model.json`` (agent envelope or flat form)
and writes ``Domain`` / ``Product`` / ``Attribute`` / ``ForeignKeyLink`` rows
keyed on a ``ModelVersion.id``. This module does the reverse: it reads those
rows back via a SQLModel ``Session`` and assembles a ``model.json`` that, when
fed back through ``sync_from_model_json``, reproduces the same structure.

Why a standalone reader (not a method on ``ModelSyncService``): the serializer
has no dependency on the sync service's WorkspaceClient / warehouse plumbing or
its private mutators — it only needs ORM reads. Keeping it here also avoids
coupling the export endpoint to the in-flight ``model_sync.py`` surface.

The export schema is the exact inverse of the import field map. The key
contract points (kept aligned with ``sync_from_model_json``):

* envelope: ``{"model": {type, name, version, description, domains[]}}`` —
  the same three-key-ish shape ``import_model.detect_schema`` unwraps. We emit
  ``type="business"`` and ``version="v{N}_{scope}"`` so a re-import passes the
  importer's v0.3+ fingerprint checks.
* ``domains[]`` → ``name`` / ``division`` / ``description`` / ``database_name``
  / ``references`` / ``products[]`` — mirrors the ``Domain`` columns that
  ``sync_from_model_json`` reads (``d.get("name")`` etc.).
* ``products[]`` → ``product`` (the importer accepts ``product`` or ``name``;
  we emit ``product`` to match what ``_assemble_model_dict`` writes) plus
  ``table_name`` / ``description`` / ``type`` / ``data_type`` / ``primary_key``
  / ``subdomain`` / ``reference`` / ``attributes[]``.
* ``attributes[]`` → ``attribute`` plus ``column_name`` / ``type`` /
  ``description`` / ``business_glossary_term`` / ``tags`` / ``value_regex`` /
  ``foreign_key_to`` (``domain.table.column``) / ``references`` / ``primary_key``.

The product-level ``primary_key`` name and ``foreign_key_to`` are the
load-bearing parts of the round-trip: on import, ``is_pk = attr_name ==
product.primary_key`` and ``fk_to`` drives the ``ForeignKeyLink`` rows. The
attribute-level ``primary_key`` boolean we emit is informational only -- it
does NOT survive the round-trip, since import re-derives each attribute's PK
flag from the product-level ``primary_key`` name rather than reading the
per-attribute boolean.
