"""Operation primitive contract for the orchestrator.

See `docs/orchestrator-design.md` §2 for the full design rationale.

An ``Operation`` is the smallest unit the orchestrator can dispatch. Each
implementation owns a single Databricks job launch (or a single in-process
side effect) and exposes a deterministic rollback. ``Operation`` instances
are singletons registered at startup; the runtime state of a single use of
an operation lives in ``RunOperation`` rows persisted by the orchestrator.

The dataclasses below are the value objects exchanged between the
orchestrator and operation implementations:

* ``OperationContext`` — read-only inputs an operation receives at dispatch
  time.
* ``OperationDispatchHandle`` — opaque cookie returned by ``dispatch()`` so
  ``observe()`` can find the in-flight work again across poll cycles or
  process restarts.
* ``OperationObservation`` — snapshot of progress the orchestrator polls.
* ``OperationResult`` — terminal payload describing what the operation
  produced and how to roll it back.
