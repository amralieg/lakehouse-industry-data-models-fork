"""Progress-table schema compat for legacy STRING `_vibe_progress.result_json`.

Background
----------
Pre-v0.5 builds of the modelling agent created `_metamodel._vibe_progress` with
`result_json STRING`. v0.5.x+ uses `parse_json(...)` on the INSERT path, which
returns VARIANT. Inserting VARIANT into STRING fails with
`CANNOT_UP_CAST_DATATYPE`, breaking every flush (the user sees "Running —
waiting for agent to report progress" until timeout).

The app's READ path is already compatible — `progress_tracker` wraps
`result_json` in `CAST(... AS STRING)`, which works for both schemas. The fix
is purely on the agent-side INSERT path: detect legacy STRING schemas before
launch and repair them so the agent's `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` recreates
the table with VARIANT.

Strategy
--------
Option B from the plan: on a model-producing launch, check
`information_schema.columns` for the column type; if STRING, DROP the table
and let the agent recreate it as VARIANT on the first flush. This is safe
because the app mirrors every consumed event to Lakebase
(`run_progress_events`) — the Delta table is event log only, not a source of
truth for anything the app later reads.

Best-effort: any failure (permissions, warehouse unreachable, legacy
workspace that can't be repaired) is logged at WARN and swallowed. The run
still launches; if the legacy schema is present, the agent will fail at
first flush with the old error — which is no worse than today.
