"""Volume and Unity Catalog path builders.

Centralised so the layout doesn't diverge between the agent's contract
(what the notebook writes) and the app's read paths (what the backend
fetches/lists). All helpers are pure functions — no I/O.

The ``deployment_catalog`` argument every builder takes is concern A (the
metamodel catalog): callers MUST pass a resolver result from
:mod:`core._catalogs` (:func:`resolve_metamodel_catalog` for
installation-wide reads, or :func:`resolve_version_volume_catalog` for
per-version artifact reads), never an inline ``x or y`` fallback. These
builders stay pure and take the already-resolved string.

The business segment is derived with :func:`core._names.agent_business_segment`,
which mirrors the agent's ``sanitize_name(strip_stop_words=False)`` rule -
the exact transform the agent applies when it writes the business folder.
Routing every path builder through it guarantees the app's READ paths land
on the same folder the agent WROTE, including for digit-prefixed business
names (which get a leading ``_`` so the segment is a legal UC identifier).
