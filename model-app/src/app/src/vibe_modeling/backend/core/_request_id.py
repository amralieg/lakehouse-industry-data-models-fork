"""Request-ID correlation middleware (PLAN #53).

Threads a per-request correlation ID through every log record produced
inside the request lifecycle, plus any background asyncio tasks spawned
while the request is being handled.

How it works:
  - On each inbound HTTP request, ``RequestIdMiddleware`` reads the
    ``X-Request-Id`` header (case-insensitive) if the upstream proxy set
    one. Databricks Apps' reverse proxy supplies it; in dev / tests we
    generate a UUID4 fallback.
  - The id is bound to the ``current_request_id`` ``ContextVar`` for the
    duration of the request. ``ContextVar`` follows ``asyncio`` task
    boundaries, so any logger call from a route handler picks it up.
  - The same id is echoed back as the ``X-Request-Id`` response header so
    the client can correlate a server-side trace to its UI action without
    re-reading network logs.
  - Background asyncio tasks (e.g. ``ProgressTracker.start_tracking``)
    spawn off the request thread; without help they would inherit the
    ``ContextVar`` *snapshot* but not the request id from a *different*
    handler that fires later. Use ``copy_context_for_task`` to give the
    spawn site a chance to run the coroutine inside the same context.

Logging integration is in :mod:`vibe_modeling.backend.core._config` —
the ``request_id`` LogRecord attribute is populated by the
``RequestIdLogFilter`` registered on the root logger.
