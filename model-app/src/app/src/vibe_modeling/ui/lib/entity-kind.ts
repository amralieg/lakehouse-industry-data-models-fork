 * Label helpers for the ``businesses.kind`` discriminator (ADR D-046).
 *
 * An *industry* is a ``businesses`` row with ``kind='industry'`` — it shares
 * the entire business pipeline (same id space, same explorer/runs routes) but
 * is surfaced to the user as an "Industry", NEVER as a "meta-business" or as a
 * plain "Business". These helpers are the single source of truth for the
 * user-facing noun so every surface (list, explorer, deployments) stays in
 * sync; don't inline ``kind === 'industry' ? ... : ...`` ternaries.
