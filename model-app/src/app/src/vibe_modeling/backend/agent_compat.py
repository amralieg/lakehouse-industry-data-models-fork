"""Agent release-tag compatibility matrix for the import-from-volume path.

The app pins a single supported agent tag (`SUPPORTED_AGENT_VERSION`), but the
auditor at `compat_matrix.json` surveyed a range of
adjacent tags and produced a verdict per tag. This module encodes that
verdict map as data so the import endpoints can reject imports from tags we
have not vetted and route `needs-adapter` tags through a (future) shim
layer.

All three verdict branches (`compatible`, `needs-adapter`, `breaking`) are
implemented even though today's matrix only contains `compatible` entries;
the shape of the API must not change when the next agent release classifies
differently.

This module also carries a forward-looking **known-upstream-changes** table
(`KNOWN_UPSTREAM_CHANGES`, newest at top) so the release-monitor CI job and
the `/api/config/agent-compat` endpoint can render human-readable compat
summaries for tags the app has not yet adopted. Entries here do NOT imply
the tag is vetted for import — they are pre-populated by whoever surveyed
the upstream diff. Treat them as metadata that feeds the monitor UI.
