"""Detect dead / overlapping fields on `*In` Pydantic models.

Bug 4 in Phase 4.5: `RunIn` had both `catalog: str = ""` and
`deployment_catalog: str = ""`. Pydantic accepted both. The frontend
sent `catalog`. The DAG factory read `req.catalog`. Anyone calling the
API directly with `deployment_catalog` had it silently ignored.

This test enforces: every public field on every `*In` model must be
read at least once by the router/services layer. A field with zero
read sites is either dead code (delete it) or a bug (the route should
read it).

The check is conservative: it greps for `data.<field>` and `req.<field>`
patterns in the router + services trees. False negatives are possible
(e.g. fields read via `**dict_unpack`), so failures should be inspected
not just suppressed. The fix is usually to add the field to a
DEPRECATED list at module-top of the model OR to remove it.

Pattern: any future rename that leaves a stale field, any merge that
ships a duplicate covering the same domain, will fail this test on
the next run.
