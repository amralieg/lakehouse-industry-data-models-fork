/**
 * Wraps an admin-only Settings tab so non-admins see it read-only up front,
 * not just when a save 403s.
 *
 * The current role comes from the shared `useUserRole` signal
 * (`/api/user/role`). When the role is KNOWN to be below the required level,
 * the section renders a "Requires admin access" notice and a
 * `<fieldset disabled>` - which natively disables every input, select, and
 * button inside, so the whole tab becomes view-only in one place instead of
 * per-field wiring. When the role is unknown (still loading, RBAC disabled so
 * everyone resolves to app_admin, or the endpoint errored) the section stays
 * fully editable: gating only ever tightens on a positive non-admin signal, so
 * the default deploy (RBAC off) and the offline/error cases never lock a user
 * out.
 *
 * `scope="app"` gates to app admins (Agent, Platform, Sources);
 * `scope="business"` also admits business admins (Sectors). Preferences is not
 * gated - it is per-user and editable by everyone.
