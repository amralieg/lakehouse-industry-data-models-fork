"""Orchestrator runner — DAG walker that drives Runs through their
primitive sequence.

See ``docs/orchestrator-design.md`` §4 (interface), §6 (failure
semantics), §7 (rollback stack).

The :class:`Orchestrator` is the sole driver of Run lifecycles. Each run
is a linear list of :class:`RunOperation` rows persisted from the
:class:`Dag` at start time; the orchestrator advances them one-by-one by
calling each :class:`Operation`'s ``dispatch`` / ``observe`` /
``rollback`` methods.

This module is deliberately small: every interesting bit of logic
(widget construction, polling, rollback semantics) lives on the
:class:`Operation` implementation. The orchestrator just sequences
them.
