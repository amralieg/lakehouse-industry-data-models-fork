"""Industry kickstart — clone a published industry version into a fresh business.

Story-8 (ADR D-050). "Kickstarting" takes a ``kind='industry'`` meta-business
at a specific published version and stamps out a brand-new ``kind='business'``
row whose model structure + companion artifacts are a faithful copy of that
industry version. The new business records its provenance
(``source_industry_id`` / ``source_version``) so the UI can show "kickstarted
from <industry> v<N>".

The synchronous, in-request part is deliberately tiny: validate the source,
create the ``Business`` row and a ``status="running"`` audit ``Run``, commit,
return. Everything else - the model-tree copy, the VibeInput copy, the
``_metamodel`` seed, and the Volume artifact copy - runs in the background
(three phases, driving the audit Run's progress):

- **Phase 0** (:func:`_run_phase0`): for each source ``ModelVersion`` at the
  requested version int (an industry version may comprise both an ECM and an
  MVM scope), create a matching new ``ModelVersion`` and copy the model
  **structure** via :func:`copy_model_tree` (domains/products/attributes/
  fk_links, fresh ids); when ``copy_inputs`` is set, also copy the industry's
  ``origin=user`` ``VibeInput`` (feedback) rows, re-anchoring each context
  link to the cloned version's element ids by natural-key (name)
  re-resolution. All of this lands in ONE transaction, so a failure partway
  leaves no orphan ``ModelVersion`` / half-copied tree - only the
  ``Business`` and the audit ``Run`` (already committed synchronously)
  survive a phase-0 failure. On success, the audit Run's ``version_id`` is
  set to the first cloned version. The ``agent_next_vibe`` backlog is
  deliberately NOT copied here - see Phase 2.
- **Phase 1** (:func:`_run_kickstart_background`): seed
  ``<deployment_catalog>._metamodel.*`` for each cloned version via
  :func:`import_metamodel_writer.seed_metamodel_one` so the new business is
  directly iterable (the agent reads its parent model only from
  ``_metamodel``).
- **Phase 2**: copy the source version's Volume artifacts (download → upload
  into the new version's Volume dir under the deployment catalog) using
  :func:`artifact_indexer.walk_volume_dir`, then index them as ``RunArtifact``
  rows via :func:`artifact_indexer.index_artifacts_at_path`. When
  ``copy_inputs`` is set, also materializes the ``agent_next_vibe`` backlog
  for the NEW version from its own (now-copied) next-vibes artifact via
  :func:`model_sync.ingest_next_vibes` - the single canonical producer of
  those rows, keyed off the NEW version's id from the start so a later
  resync's re-parse of the same artifact is a no-op (see
  :func:`_copy_vibe_inputs`'s docstring).

Structure is the contract a kickstart preserves (domains / products /
attributes / FK links), copied directly via :func:`copy_model_tree`.
Run-provenance metadata is left at defaults on the
new version because it describes the *source* generation, not the copy:
``confidence_score`` (source self-assessment), ``vibe_instructions`` (source
run-time prompt), ``sync_state`` / ``sync_error_text`` (start ``ok`` - we sync
it ourselves). The model-level description lives on the ``Business`` row: an
explicit ``new_description`` wins, otherwise it falls back to the source
industry's description (the agent hard-requires a non-empty description for
model-producing runs, so kickstart never leaves it empty). If both are blank
(an industry seeded from a description-less ``model.json``), the request is
rejected with a 422 - the same contract ``BusinessIn.description`` enforces
on every other Business-write surface - instead of letting the business get
created and only failing a minute into the next run's fail-fast preflight.

    ``origin=agent_next_vibe`` rows are deliberately EXCLUDED here.
    ``model_sync.materialize_next_vibe_inputs`` is the single producer of
    those rows, keyed by a deterministic ``uuid5(version_id, ordinal)`` so
    re-ingesting the SAME artifact against the SAME version is a no-op. A

    new version — ids the materializer has never seen — so the FIRST sync/
    resync of the kickstarted version (which re-parses the (now copied)
    next-vibes artifact through the same materializer) treats every finding
    as new and doubles the backlog. Phase 2 of the kickstart
    (:func:`_run_kickstart_background`) materializes the next-vibes backlog
    for the new version itself, via :func:`model_sync.ingest_next_vibes`,
    once the artifact has landed in the new version's own Volume folder -
    the SAME single producer, keyed against the NEW version_id from the

    ``origin`` / ``author`` (submitter) / ``text`` / ``category`` /
    ``priority`` / ``status`` / ``confidence_score`` and the created/updated
    timestamps are preserved so lineage reads correctly;
    ``selected_for_run`` / ``consumed`` start at their column defaults so a
    fresh business does not auto-dispatch inherited inputs.

    Re-anchoring resolves every carried link's natural key against an
    :class:`AnchorMaps` prefetched once per distinct target version (not
    once per link), and the resulting ``VibeInputContextLink`` rows go in
