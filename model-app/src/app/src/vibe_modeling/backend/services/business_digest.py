"""Extract business identity + context from a model.json payload.

Agent exports carry the business identity in two places:

- ``model_requirements.business_name`` / ``model_requirements.description``
  — what the user typed when starting the run
- ``model.industry_alignment`` and ``model.{core_business_processes,
  orgnaization_divisions, common_business_jargons,
  operational_systems_of_records, industry_governing_body}`` —
  the agent's mirror of the business-context block

This module unwraps both layouts (envelope and flat) and returns a
single ``BusinessDigest`` the import flow uses for two things:

1. Story 1 (create-business-by-importing): seed the new ``Business`` row
   without making the user retype identity that's already in the file.
2. Story 2 (import into existing business): diff the digest against the
   target ``Business`` so the UI can warn on mismatched name/industry
   before the import lands.
