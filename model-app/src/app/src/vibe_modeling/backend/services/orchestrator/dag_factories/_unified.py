"""DAG factory for the ``new-base-model`` intent (group C).

DAG shape (uniform across all ``cataloging_style`` values):

    ``generate_ecm`` → ``shrink_to_mvm``

The agent inline-installs in every cataloging style (integration guide
§12 "Operational Modes" — Stage 12 Physical Schema Construction runs
inside both ``generate_ecm`` and ``shrink_to_mvm`` regardless of style).
A separate explicit ``install`` op would re-run the install pointing at
the same place the agent already wrote to. See the Decision Log entry
"Multi-catalog new-base-model DAGs collapsed from 4 phases to 2".

The factory is a pure function: it consults the request, the business,
the agent config, and any business context, but does not touch the DB
or the workspace. The validator (``services.orchestrator.validate``)
takes the produced :class:`Dag` and runs each step's
``params_model`` plus the cross-step rules.
