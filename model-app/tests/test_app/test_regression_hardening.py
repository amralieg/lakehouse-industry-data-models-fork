"""Regression tests for shipped hardening (PLAN #54).

Covers four recently-landed security fixes so subsequent refactors can't
silently re-open them:

  - C-02 — SQL injection via business name on the Delta read paths.
  - C-09 — ``POST /businesses/{id}/seed-model`` admin-only guard.
  - C-10 — ``volume_path`` traversal validation on
    ``POST /businesses/{id}/versions/import-from-volume``.
  - RBAC-on-all-routes — see ``test_rbac_coverage.py`` for the route
    walker; this file covers the per-fix behavioural assertions.

These tests deliberately call the FastAPI app via ``TestClient`` rather
than patching internals — the regression we want to catch is "an attacker
hitting the public endpoint" not "an internal helper".
