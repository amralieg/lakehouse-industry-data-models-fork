"""Skeptical tests for the ``v_0_3_0`` migration (Phase 5 — state-machine
retirement).

The migration's contract per ``docs/orchestrator-design.md`` §5.1:

1. Drop ``runs.run_type`` if it exists.
2. Drop ``runs.rollback_plan`` if it exists.
3. Be idempotent — re-applying against a database whose columns are
   already gone (or only one of them is gone) must succeed silently.
4. Be registered in ``vibe_modeling.backend.migrations.MIGRATIONS`` so
   ``reconcile_schema()`` picks it up at boot.
5. Have a stable version key (``"0.3.0"``) that sorts strictly higher
   than ``"0.2.0"``.

Plus the parallel owner-script contract: ``scripts/db/migrate.py`` must
expose a ``DROP_COLUMNS`` list whose entries cover the same ``(table,
column)`` pairs the registry would drop. The drift coverage is mirrored
in ``test_migration_drift_owner.py``; this file tests the symbol's
existence and basic shape.

Stub-for-integration pattern
----------------------------

The dev agent owns the implementation files in parallel. We never import
``v_0_3_0`` directly — we only test through the public registry surface
(``MIGRATIONS``, ``reconcile_schema``). When a contract is testable only
via a freshly-introduced symbol (e.g., ``DROP_COLUMNS`` in the owner
script) we attempt the import lazily and ``pytest.fail`` (NOT skip) with
a clear ``STUB-FOR-INTEGRATION`` message — failure is the correct signal
during the parallel-agent merge window.
