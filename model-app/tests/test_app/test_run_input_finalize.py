"""Atomicity of the run-completion finalize hook (_finalize_run_inputs).

On SUCCESS: flip VibeInput.consumed=true for each input the run attempted (its
RunInputLink rows) + clear selected_for_run, in ONE commit. On FAILURE: consume
nothing and DELETE the run's RunInputLink rows so the inputs re-pool clean;
selected_for_run is preserved.

The headline test forces an exception mid-finalize and asserts the single
commit boundary held: ZERO RunInputLink rows persisted AND every selected
input still consumed=false. Locks input_state_atomicity. See §6.
