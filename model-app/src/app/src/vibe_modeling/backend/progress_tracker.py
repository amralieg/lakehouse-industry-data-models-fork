        ``stage_warning`` (e.g. 7 of 22 metric views fail to compile because
        the LLM hallucinated columns that don't exist on the underlying

        enlarge, vibe-iterate) then refuse via ``_version_is_incomplete()``
        which strictly checks ``< 100``.

        The model is functionally complete at Session Ended — every
        downstream-relevant artifact (model.json, schemas, FKs,

        artifact that should not gate downstream operations once the

        the normal happy path. It always stamps ``completion_date``.

            by default), cheap SELECT against ``_vibe_progress`` plus
            inserts into ``run_progress_events``. Surfaces agent events
            in the UI within seconds, regardless of how long the advance
            tick is taking.
          * ``_advance_loop_inner`` — every ``poll_interval_seconds`` (10s
            by default), pays cold-warehouse latency for Jobs API +
            ``orchestrator.advance`` + handshake ack. This is also the
            loop that decides terminal state.

        Drift-unification (Phase 7, Item 3): this is the only
        multi-cadence "fast drain + slow advance" poll loop in the
        codebase. The other polling sites are single-cadence:

          * ``install/provision_lakebase.py`` — single 5s sync poll
            for endpoint host assignment.
          * ``scripts/smoke/e2e_run.py`` / ``e2e_full.py`` — single 60s
            sync poll for run terminal state.
          * ``services/operations/vibe_iterate.py`` /
            ``_generation_common.py`` — exponential-backoff retry on
            ``ws.files.download`` failure, not a status poll.
          * UI ``components/diagram/diagram-viewer.tsx`` — single 2s
            client-side poll for 200/202 layout-compute status.

        None of them have a fast/slow pair, so there's nothing to
        unify into a shared ``cooperative_split_poll`` helper. If a
        second multi-cadence site appears, extract this loop's
        ``_run_split_loops`` + child-loop scaffolding into a generic
        helper and migrate both sites at once.

        When either child returns (run reached terminal, or the Run row
        is gone), the other is cancelled and ``_poll_loop`` exits.

        Retries transient errors at the outer level so a flaky tick
        doesn't kill tracking on the first hiccup. When retries are
        exhausted, ``_handle_watchdog_exit`` decides whether to fail the
        run based on the *Databricks job state* — if the underlying job
        is still running we mark it ``stale`` and let the next app
        startup resume tracking.
