"""Boot-time schema migrations.

Re-exports the public surface (``reconcile_schema``, the lifecycle
constants, the error type) from :mod:`registry`, and registers each
``v_X_Y_Z.MIGRATION`` into the module-level ``MIGRATIONS`` list in
ascending order. Add a new migration by importing it here and appending
it to the list — reconcile depends on the order.
