"""Download + materialize a GitHub industry model into Lakebase (Story 4/7).

Pulls a published ``model.json`` (and its companion artifacts) out of the
configured GitHub source and lands it as a brand-new ``kind='industry'``
:class:`Business` plus its first :class:`ModelVersion`. Synchronous: unlike
the agent run path, there is no Databricks job — the bytes already exist at
rest in the repo, so a download is a read + sync.

Flow (``download_industry_model``):

1. Build the GitHub connector from the installation's ``agent_config``
   (mirrors :func:`routes.sources._connector`).
2. ``fetch_model_json`` → ``json.loads`` → :func:`import_model.detect_schema`,
   which UNWRAPS the ``{"model": ...}`` envelope. The business identity and
   the synced domains come from the unwrapped inner ``model`` — never the
   top-level ``model_name``/``domains`` keys (the routes/sources.py:168 bug).
3. Validate the target sector exists (404 otherwise).
4. Reconcile per the model-scope conflict unit: create a new industry,
   add a never-seen scope to an existing one, or 409 a same-scope clash.
5. Construct the ``Business`` directly here (NOT via the create_business
   route): ``kind='industry'``, ``sector_id`` set, ``source_industry_id``
   left NULL — a downloaded industry is itself the source, not a kickstart.
6. Create the draft ``ModelVersion`` + sync the model via
   :class:`ModelSyncService`.
7. Materialize each fetched artifact's bytes onto the Volume, index them with
   :func:`services.artifact_indexer.index_artifacts_at_path`, and materialize
   the source's next-vibe backlog via :func:`model_sync.ingest_next_vibes`.
8. Commit, then seed ``<deployment_catalog>._metamodel.*`` via
   :func:`import_metamodel_writer.write_metamodel` so the downloaded industry
   is directly iterable (the agent reads its parent model only from
   ``_metamodel``). Best-effort, external, post-commit, non-fatal.
9. Write the audit :class:`Run` (``Run.business_id`` is required, so the
   business must be committed first); its timestamps are stamped equal and it
   carries the source lineage in ``vibe_instructions_text``.
